Here are the 8 things I would take more seriously. (not in the specific order)

𝟭. 𝗡𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴:
- Command-level operations are fine. 
- To excel in system architecture, deep knowledge of network protocols, IP routing, firewall management, and secure communication channels is essential.

𝟮. 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗟𝗜: 
- GUIs are intuitive, but incomplete. 
- Get started with CLI from Day 1. 
- Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, AWS - you name it, every single provider has a CLI.

𝟯. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴: 
- DevOps is not just about connecting tools.
- Automating tasks, writing hooks, API integration, and more needs solid programming expertise. 
- Python, Go, Rust are promising choices.

𝟰. 𝗔𝗣𝗜𝘀:
- No day goes by without an API.
- Authentication methods like OAuth, JWT, and contract testing are crucial for smooth service integration.
- Knowing how to effectively consume and design RESTful services cannot be a choice.

𝟱. 𝗗𝗲𝗯𝘂𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴:
- Robust troubleshooting skills across apps and infrastructure are non-negotiable. 
- Tools such as `strace`, `netstat`, `tcpdump`, and app-specific debuggers enable swift, effective problem-solving.
- Tools aren't enough; couple it with an open mindset.

𝟲. 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗛𝘆𝗴𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗲:
- Being security responsible from the start is imperative. 
- Strict adherence to least privilege, RBAC, centralized secrets management, and a single source of truth is mandatory.

𝟳. 𝗘𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴:
- Mastering how to catch, handle, and log exceptions can be a lifesaver in unexpected failure scenarios.

𝟴. 𝗦𝗼𝗳𝘁 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀: 
- Business is about dealing with humans; technology is built by and for humans.
- Effectively working in a team, understanding requirements, and clearly presenting technical solutions are underrated. 
- But that makes all the difference more than anything else.

It's not about 'what if I start learning today.'
